  To install the dependencies listed in this file, run:
    opam install . --deps-only

  ---

  To optionally isolate these dependencies to the current folder, create a "switch" like so:
    opam switch create . {OCAML_VERSION} --deps-only

  Or optionally install as a global switch with a custom name:
    opam switch create caqti-study 5.1.0

  ---

  Run this to find the latest OCaml version:
    opam switch list-available | grep -E 'base-compiler.+Official'

  ---

  To find your current switch configuration, run:
    opam switch

  ---

  Other useful commands:
    - opam switch       # find currently installed switches
    - opam switch 5.1.0 # change to the 5.10 switch configuration
